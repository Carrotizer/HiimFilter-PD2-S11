# Skill Points
## Bone Prison / Bone Wall?
Pretty fun utilities.  At least 1 point each.  Potentially more for Bone Armor synergy. 
At lv 16, 23 life per hit, so 105 life per hit.  

TODO: After respec, try mapping with no investment in Blood Golem/Golem Mastery.  
Then try with 5 points in Golem Mastery

## Golem Mastery?
Not worth investment.  20 Revive is clearly best/most fun.
Blood Golems are too weak with remaining points.

## 1 point in Lower Resist?
Try this on next stat reset.
...maybe.  1 second duration so there's very little up-time....



# Bossing
