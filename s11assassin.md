# Blade Fury
* Target furthest in a line: https://www.theamazonbasin.com/wiki/index.php/Blade_Fury
"Blades do not pierce, so the best way to attack these Ghoul Lords is to aim at the last one. (otherwise the attack animation will have to wind down and wind up again as each selected Ghoul Lord is killed and the next is selected manually)."
* Dual claw: only primary
* The following do NOT work with Blade Fury:
  Damage + (e.g. Grief)
  Chance to Cast On Attack
* Neither attack rate nor cast rate will increase firing frequency.
  * A single click fires two blades, but it is better to fire blades continuously (one every six frames) without selecting a target by selecting it for the right mouse button and holding it down, or selecting it for the left mouse button and holding it down with the Shift key to prevent movement.

# Blade Sentinel

# Mercenary
## Act 1 Vigor
Faith/Mist.  Faith seems better.
Note +1 skill from Tyrael's Might wouldn't increase movement speed for Vigor by itself (1% movespeed every other level).

0, 9, 19, 32, 54, 86, 152 (8 frame max)
