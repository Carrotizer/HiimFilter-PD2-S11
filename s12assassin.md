Rest in Fade and Weapon Block appropriately

Shadow Killer has 33% chance to cast level 24 Frost Nova on striking.  Blade Shield could be fun.
Or if GG caster claw has amplify damage on striking.
* Never mind - Chance to Cast on Striking gives a percentage chance to use a skill whenever the equipping player character, mercenary or pet uses a weapon attack which does not miss and is not blocked, or to which Dodge, Avoid, Evade or Weapon Block are not applied.
Unlikely to not miss, so ignore Blade Shield regardless of chance to proc.  Rely on merc for curse.

# Critical Damage
As per wiki, total Crit Chance: 1 - ((1 - DS) * (1 - CS) * (1 - WM)) (rounded down to the nearest percent)
With 75% DS from gear, Lvl 31+ Claw Mastery gives 23% crit chance.
* 1 - (1 - 0.75) * (1 - 0.23) * 1 = 1 - 0.195 = 0.805, rounded down to 0.8

This means with 75% DS, you only need 20% crit chance from claw mastery (Lv 16)!
